**Problem**
-
Major institutions like San Jose State University manage a vast number of students, faculty, and other personnel. Managing the records of such a substantial population without a digital system would be overwhelming. Manually searching and retrieving information for those associated with the university would be impractical and inefficient.


Our project addresses the following issues:
- Lack of reliable employee management system.
- Difficulty keeping track of a large populous of staff and students.
- No classification between staff and student.

**Functionality**  
-
The system will feature:
- Student's Registration Module: Captures essential student details for enrollment.
- Teacher's Module: Records faculty data and professional engagements.
    
**Description**
-
Our team is developing an integrated management system to streamline the handling of student and faculty data, addressing current challenges in tracking and classification. Utilizing MYSQL DBMS for data storage and leveraging JSWING on ECLIPSE for a user-friendly interface. 

Beyond its core functionalities, this project offers team members valuable hands-on experience in MYSQL CRUD operations, data transactions, and interface design, ensuring technical growth alongside project completion.
